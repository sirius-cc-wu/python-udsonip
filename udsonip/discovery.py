    Discover ECUs on the DoIP network using hybrid discovery.

    This function performs ISO 13400-2 compliant hybrid discovery:
    1. Broadcasts a Vehicle Identification Request to actively trigger responses

    This approach finds both ECUs that respond to requests and those that send
    spontaneous announcements (e.g., newly connected devices).
